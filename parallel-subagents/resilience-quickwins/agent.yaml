objective: >
  Implement the two lowest-risk hardening changes that reduce production failure impact
  without blocking UI redesign work:
  (1) UI-generated Idempotency-Key on write requests,
  (2) GET /readyz endpoint with dependency-aware readiness signals.

why_now:
  - "Current risk includes duplicate updates during retries/double-submits."
  - "Current health endpoint is liveness-only and does not expose dependency degradation."
  - "These are high-value, low-blast-radius changes that can run in parallel with UI refresh."

primary_references:
  - "docs/RESILIENCE_SELF_CORRECTION_FINDINGS.md"
  - "app/ui/main.js"
  - "services/api/src/app.js"
  - "services/api/src/clients/sling.js"
  - "services/api/src/clients/caspio.js"
  - "services/api/test/http-routes.test.js"

in_scope:
  - "Add Idempotency-Key generation and header wiring in UI API request path."
  - "Ensure POST /api/shifts/bulk sends Idempotency-Key."
  - "Optionally send Idempotency-Key for PUT /api/shifts/:occurrenceId (safe and additive)."
  - "Add GET /readyz route returning readiness summary with dependency states."
  - "Add/adjust tests for new readyz behavior and idempotency header behavior where feasible."

out_of_scope:
  - "Replacing process-local idempotency cache with Redis/Firestore."
  - "Compensating transaction queue / rollback reconciler."
  - "Caspio retry/timeout redesign."
  - "UI visual redesign or CSS/layout changes."
  - "Infra rollout policy changes (load balancer/probe config updates)."

  avoid_touching_paths:
    - "pastVersions/"
    - "app/ui/styles.css"
    - "app/ui/index.html"
    - "services/api/src/routes/"

implementation_requirements:
  - "Do not change existing API routes/response schemas except adding /readyz."
  - "Keep /healthz behavior unchanged for backward compatibility."
  - "Preserve X-Request-Id behavior."
  - "Treat readiness as non-destructive checks only."
  - "Return clear machine-readable status fields in /readyz response."

  behavior:
    - "200 when all required dependency checks pass."
    - "503 when one or more required checks fail."
    - "Include per-dependency check detail (status + reason/code when failed)."

quality_bar:
  - "No regression in existing tests."
  - "New route and header behavior covered by tests."
  - "No secret/token literals."
  - "No unrelated refactors."

verification_commands:
  - "cd services/api && npm test"

deliverables:
  - "Code changes limited to allowed_edit_paths."
  - "Updated tests proving /readyz and idempotency header wiring."
  - "Completed handoff using handoff-template.md."
